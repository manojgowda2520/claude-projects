"""Prometheus exposition.

Two views of the same number, because they answer different questions:

  costlens_resource_usd_per_hour   gauge   - "what is this thing costing me right now"
  costlens_resource_usd_total      counter - "what has it cost since the collector started"

The counter is integrated from the gauge rather than read from AWS: on every snapshot
each series accrues rate x elapsed. That makes a missed or slow scrape lose a little
accuracy but never double-count, and lets `increase()` and `rate()` work normally in
PromQL over any window.

Cardinality is the real operational risk here - a big account has tens of thousands of
log groups and Lambda versions, and one series per resource per dimension will melt a
small Prometheus. Two guards: a floor on hourly rate, and a top-N cap per
(account, region, service) with everything below it folded into a single __other__
series so the totals still add up.
